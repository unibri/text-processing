# textprocessing
Text processing program created in C++
## Description
This program reads a .txt file and counts the amount of times a word has been read using a binary tree. 

*Note: words in upper case and lower case are treated the same.*

I.e. TACOS and tacos are treated as the same word
## Bugs
- .txt files downloaded may not be processed correctly. To work around this, copy and paste text directly from source.
